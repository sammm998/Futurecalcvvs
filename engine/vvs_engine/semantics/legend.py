"""The drawing's own designation list.

Every one of these drawings carries a legend - a column of short codes, each with the words that say what it
is, under headings that group them. It is the drawing telling us its own vocabulary: which codes are systems,
which are pipe materials, which are components that will never be a pipe. Read from the page like everything
else, per job, and never carried between drawings.

Per job, not per sheet. A set writes its designation list once, on the sheet that has room for it, and the plan
sheets are governed by it without repeating it. A reading that looks for the list on each sheet alone finds it
on one of them and, on all the others, concludes the drawing has no vocabulary at all - so every label passes as
possibly a pipe, the review list fills with door marks and room numbers, and the same project is read one way on
one sheet and another way on the next. A sheet that carries no list of its own is handed the set's, marked as
having come from elsewhere; what it may never do is silently borrow the other sheet's geometry with it.

Nothing here knows any Swedish. A legend is found by its shape - a stack of rows sharing a left edge, each a
short code beside a description - and a code's role is settled by how the drawing itself uses it: a code that
opens a dimensioned designation is a system, a code that stands alone as a whole label is a component.

    are a candidate list, and rows on that edge whose leading word is not a code are the headings above them.

    times is the same mistake with a straighter face.

    Two things separate the real list from those, and either will do:

      * the drawing uses the codes. A designation list is a vocabulary for what is drawn on the paper, so its

      * the descriptions line up. A list is set as a table - the codes in one column, the words in another - so
        the descriptions share a left edge of their own. A note's words start wherever its leading word ended.

    The first is the stronger evidence and decides between candidates; the second is what lets an index sheet,
    which carries the list for a set without drawing any of it, still be read. A stack that shows neither is a
    stack of text, and the sheet is left with no list rather than a made-up one - which costs nothing, because

# Svenskan gör det ovanligt lätt. Ett svenskt sammansatt ord bär sitt huvudord sist: en TILLUFTSDON är ett DON,
# ett BRANDGASSPJÄLL är ett SPJÄLL, en CIRKULATIONSFLÄKT är en FLÄKT. Så det räcker att se efter vad ordet
# slutar på för att veta vad saken är. Det är därför listorna nedan är ändelser och inte ord.

# stycken. En kod som listan kallar ett don är aldrig rör, hur ritningen än skriver den - och just det var vad
# som gick fel: TD102 skrivs TD102-100 med anslutningsmåttet, läsningen såg en dimension och tog donet för ett
# system, och femtio meter kanal hamnade under ett tilluftsdon.
