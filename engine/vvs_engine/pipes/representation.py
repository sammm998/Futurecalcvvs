    are not one family - reading them as one hands the pipes' vote to the walls.

    Linetype is deliberately not in this key, and that is a measured decision rather than an oversight. It is
    read - `describe_family` reconstructs each family's dash and gap from the drawing, and `build_graph` uses
    those to decide where a broken line continues - but it does not divide the family, for two reasons found in
    the drawings themselves. First, these exports carry no PDF dash array at all: across the whole style library
    every stroke is drawn solid and the dashes are separate short segments, so there is no linetype to key on
    without reconstructing it. Second, when the reconstruction is done and a family's chains are sorted into
    dashed and solid, the solid ones are almost always a bend or a fitting of a few dozen points sitting inside
    a run of several thousand points of dashes. Splitting on linetype would cut those runs in half at exactly
