"""Physical pipe ownership.

VERIFIED PipeCodeAnchors seed identities on pipe graphs. Resolution is CHAIN based (a chain = maximal run of
primitives through degree-2 nodes): a chain carrying seeds of one identity is confirmed entirely; where seeds of
different identities sit on the same chain, the geometry between them is AMBIGUOUS (DN boundary / system
conflict) - never split at an invented midpoint. At junctions an identity continues only along a collinear arm
(straight run through a tee/cross) or an arm supported by agreeing anchors; other unlabeled arms are
AMBIGUOUS_BRANCH. Every primitive ends as CONFIRMED, AMBIGUOUS or UNOWNED.
